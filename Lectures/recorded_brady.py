"""
difference between a class and an object 
class is a blueprint of an object.  class is defining the data model, like in a table. 

four principles on object oriented programming
abstraction -  think of an object in an abstract way. making an object class, what is that item or what properties does it have? 
encapsulation -  keepy everything that is good to use, or restict if need be, or not want to change. 
inheritance - family tree, it's parent to child relations.
polymorphism - many, shape.  treat one(child) as if it's another(parent).
